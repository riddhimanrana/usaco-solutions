All of my Bronze-level solutions are written in Python, while my Silver-level solutions are a mix of mostly Python but some C++ as well. By the time I reached Gold, I primarily focused on C++ for its efficiency. This repository is a collection of my progress, some of the problems I did to study, and solutionsâ€”hope you find it useful or at least interesting!
