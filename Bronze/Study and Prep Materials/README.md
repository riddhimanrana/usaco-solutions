## Practice & Preparation Notes

Please note that this does **not** represent the entirety of my practice or training. There are many other problems I did/prep materials that are not included here. It's mostly just the problems that I documented, wrote down my thought process, or developed prep materials.

A lot of the problems here are not complete, polished solutions. Instead, they are:

*   Initial thoughts and brainstorming
*   Algorithm design and pseudocode
*   Partial implementations or explorations of different approaches
*   Training notes and strategies for competitive programming contests
*   For certain problems, hand-drawn thought processes and diagrams are available in my annotations folder.
